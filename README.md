## ðŸ”¥ Features

Here are the main features of the project.

- Responsive design.

  - The Composition Pattern is a design pattern that lets you create complex structures by combining simple objects. In this notifications widget, we use composition to create different types of notifications (eg success, error, warning, etc.) from smaller, more reusable notification components.
